## Project Overview
Completing the election audit of a local congressional election. This information was provided by a Colorado Board of Elections employee.

Information needed:
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Determine county with highest voter turnout.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.2, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Challenge Overview
Using Python in Visual Studio Code, we were able to calculate the total number of votes, get a complete list of candidates, calculate the number of votes per candidate and determine the percentage of votes each candidate received. We were able to determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. We were able to read this data more clearly by using a text document within Visual Studio Code. 

## Challenge Summary
In summary, we discovered there were 3 candidates. Diana DeGette was the winner with 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes! She far surpassed the other candidates, Charles Casper Stockham who had 23% of the vote and Raymon Anthony Doane who received 3.1% of the vote. 
We also learned that Denver county had the highest voter turnout with 306,055 votes and 82.8% of total votes cast.
